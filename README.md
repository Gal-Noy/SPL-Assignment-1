This assignment was taken in System Programming Laboratory course.Its objective is to design an object-oriented system and gain
implementation experience in C++ while using classes, standard data structures, and unique
C++ properties such as the “Rule of 5”. We learned how to handle memory in C++ and avoid
memory leaks.
